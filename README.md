# Guitar Neck Calculator

Making 3D Models for guitar design?  This calculator will create cross-sections of a guitar neck which you can import into your modeling software to create an accurate guitar neck.

Useful for people milling guitars via CNC.

Features:
- Fretboard Radius
- Fretboard Thickness
- Neck Shape  **work in progress**
- Neck Depth
- Neck Width
- export PNG, JPG, BMP
- export DXF  **work in progress**

# Development Instructions
- Install `python` if not already on your system
- Install `nodejs` if you haven't (this gives you the `npm` command)

- Install dependencies   (uses nodejs `npm`)
`npm install`

- Start a server on <http://localhost:8000/>   (uses `python`)
`npm start`

# Future Work
- TODO: All shapes are **eyeballed from my own memory**.  Need to trace in some actual neck profile shapes when i get some time in front of inkscape (see `drawCshape()` functions, and friends)
- TODO: DXF exporter is unfinished... currently you'll need to trace your vectors over the exported Image...
- TODO: Currently `Depth` is measured from the bottom of the fretboard curve.  But perhaps it should be measured from the top of the fretboard rounded surface??  I could put this on an option toggle if both are valid.
